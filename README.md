# My App with React + TypeScript + Vite

In this project, I've used the following technologies:

React for building the user interface.
TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
Vite for fast build and development.
Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
React Router for client-side routing and navigation.
React Query for data fetching, caching, and state management.
